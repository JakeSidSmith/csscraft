## About

This began as an experiment to see how easy it would be, and if it was plausible, to use purely CSS as a rendering engine for a Minecraft-like scene.

It turns out, it's quite easy to render some blocks, but the frame rate drops considerably when you add a hundred or so.

Then I figured, why not add some javascript and make it interactive?

The final CSSCraft just renders a single block, and allows the user to build whatever they want on top of this.

## Controls

1. Click / tap on the side of a block to add another

2. Click / press and hold on a block to destroy it (you cannot destroy the initial block)

3. You can switch blocks with the tool bar at the bottom (which is scrollable on smaller screens)

4. Click / press and drag to rotate the screen

5. Scroll / pinch to zoom
